# Abcdefgh

## Bcdefgh

### Cdefgh

#### Defgh

_This text will be italic_
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
**This will also be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

- Start a line with a star

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

```javascript
const a = 'nekineki';

const test = () => {
  console.log('test abcdefgh');
};
```

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
  printf("Hello world");
}
```
